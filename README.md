# BayesianVsClassical

This PDF document presents a comparison between the Bayesian and classical approaches, using the analogy of an F1 racing track. 
By using formulas from both approaches to calculate confidence intervals (CI), it becomes possible to predict the optimal placement of 
healthcare personnel in case of an unprecedented incident.
The resulting CIs create boundaries within which the personnel can be positioned with greater accuracy.
